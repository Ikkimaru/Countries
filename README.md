# Countries

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.8 using data retrieved from [REST Countries](https://restcountries.com/). 
It is designed to provide users with a comprehensive and engaging experience for exploring countries around the world. 
The project features an interactive list of country names that can be filtered and paginated for easier navigation. 

Users can select a region and subregion through dropdown menus to narrow down their country choices, leading to detailed information displayed in a dedicated country information page. 
This page showcases essential details such as the country's name, flag, coat of arms, official name, geographical coordinates, region, population, area, capital city, and demonyms, along with translations and spoken languages. 

Additionally, it includes an interactive Earth map that dynamically populates country and capital locations using clickable dots, enhancing the visual experience. 
With search functionalities and overlays for country details, this project offers a user-friendly interface for discovering and learning about global geography.
